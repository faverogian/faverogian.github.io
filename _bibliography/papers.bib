  abstract={Major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have already marketed electric vehicles in large scale but apart from business strategies and policies, the real engineering problems must be addressed. Lithium-ion batteries are a promising technology for energy storage; however, their low energy density and complex electro-chemical nature, compared to fossil fuels, presents additional challenges. Their complex nature and strong temperature dependence during operation must be studied with additional accuracy, capable to predict their behavior. In this research, a pseudo two dimensional (P2D) electro-chemical model, for a recent high capacity NMC pouch cell for automotive applications is developed. The electrochemical model with its temperature dependent parameters is validated at high, low, and reference temperature within 10°C to 50°C temperature range. For each temperature various discharge C-rates to accurately replicate the battery cell operational conditions. The overall goodness of the model is proven with limited RMS errors in all the cases. Low temperatures and high C-rates are discovered to limit sensibly the battery performances. The complete analysis provides valuable design considerations for the battery thermal management system (BTMS) to enhance performance, cycle life and safety of future electrified vehicle energy storage systems.},

      title={Beyond FVD: Enhanced Evaluation Metrics for Video Generation Quality}, 
      author={Ge Ya Luo and Gian Mario Favero and Zhi Hao Luo and Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau and Christopher Pal},
      abstract={The Frechet Video Distance (FVD) is a widely adopted metric for evaluating video generation distribution quality. However, its effectiveness relies on critical assumptions. Our analysis reveals three significant limitations: (1) the non-Gaussianity of the Inflated 3D Convnet (I3D) feature space; (2) the insensitivity of I3D features to temporal distortions; (3) the impractical sample sizes required for reliable estimation. These findings undermine FVD's reliability and show that FVD falls short as a standalone metric for video generation evaluation. After extensive analysis of a wide range of metrics and backbone architectures, we propose JEDi, the JEPA Embedding Distance, based on features derived from a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, measured using Maximum Mean Discrepancy with polynomial kernel. Our experiments on multiple open-source datasets show clear evidence that it is a superior alternative to the widely used FVD metric, requiring only 16% of the samples to reach its steady value, while increasing alignment with human evaluation by 34%, on average.},
